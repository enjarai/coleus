# Coleus
Coleus is an addon for [Lavender](https://modrinth.com/mod/lavender) that allows for viewing guidebooks in a browser. It generates an html version of each guidebook and hosts them locally.

## Usage
Open a book and click on the button in the bottom right corner of the book with the label "Open Web Book".
Each book can also be located in the `coleus` directory of the instance folder.
- Note that the books will only be hosted locally while the game is running. To view the books in your browser while the game is not running, you will need to host them yourself.

## For Developers
Coleus will be able to generate a book for any lavender book without any addition setup.
However, you may want to customize the appearance of the web book for your mod.
Instructions on how to do this are located on the [wiki](https://github.com/Master-Bw3/Coleus/wiki/Customization-Guide).
